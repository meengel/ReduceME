# ReduceME
A small tool for parallelized reducing method in Python. It is built for tasks where the reducing of two items is very costly already. For these cases, this tool results in a significant performance increase! Have fun and ask questions if necessary!

Please note that we also provide the possibility to reduce more than two items in one iteration. This enables the user to either sum up a vast amount of numbers or to merge multiple files in one step, for example.
